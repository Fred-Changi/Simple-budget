This project emerged as a solution for people, who tend not to have a clear answer of where they
spend their money. This is especially true, when it comes to food which for most people, is bought daily.

This spreadsheet allows the user to input their expenditure for the three main meals of the day, Breakfast, Lunch, and Supper, for the entire month.
(But it can be adjusted acordingly depending on the need.)

The spreadsheet will automatically calculate your daily spend, and at the end of the week it will calculate your weekly spend.

The weekly spend of each week is linked to a bar chart, that directly compares the spend for each week across the month, so that the user can 
see, at a glance, which week of the month, they spent the most, for further investigation as needed.

Conditional formatting can be added as per user specific needs to identify when the expected expenditure is exceeded.
